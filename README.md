#SEO Vietnam Web Project

##Architecture
- [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) as the backend
- Either [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) or [Angular](http://angularjs.org) for client-side framework

##Process
Features for this project are broken down into phases. Each phase will then be explored and worked on in sprints.

See [List of features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hk36Bf8GnJ5-DseO01he3SjYVuwSTCj15OjyUBy-qx0/edit?usp=sharing).

Each sprint will be a [milestone](https://github.com/tnguyen14/seo-vietnam/issues/milestones), and each feature and bug in the sprint will be handled by [project issues](https://github.com/tnguyen14/seo-vietnam/issues).

##Development Environment
We are exploring [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) as the virtual dev environment.

[A guide](https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants) on how to get it set up with WordPress.
